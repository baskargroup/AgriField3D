## Abstract

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in three-dimensional (3D) agricultural research, particularly for maize, has been limited by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets. While 2D image datasets are abundant, they cannot capture essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and spatial arrangements that 3D data can provide. To address this limitation, we present a curated dataset of 3D point clouds of fully field-grown maize plants with diverse genetic backgrounds designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset comprises over 1,000 high-quality point clouds representing diverse maize varieties collected using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner. To enhance the usability of the dataset, we performed graph-based segmentation to isolate individual leaves and stalk point clouds. Each leaf is assigned a consistent color label across all plants based on its order from bottom to top. Similarly, all stalks are assigned a single, distinct color. A rigorous quality control process was undertaken to manually correct any errors in the segmentation and leaf ordering, ensuring accurate segmentation and consistent color labeling. The dataset includes metadata describing point cloud quality, the number of leaves, and the presence of tassels and maize cobs. This dataset lays the foundation for leveraging 3D data to enable advanced applications in agricultural research, particularly for maize phenotyping and plant structure studies.
