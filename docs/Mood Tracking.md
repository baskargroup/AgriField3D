-   **Physical and Mental Symptoms** : I was feeling good this morning, practiced self talk and presentation. Then I went out to pick up an item from Agronomy. I drove their and walked from the parking lot. I was windy and bit cold, temp around 6 degrees but the windchill 2 degrees. I was not wearing any hat or gloves. after coming back to CCL i had an headache and can't focus, seems brain fog
- **Positive Feelings**: walk around, talking to people, explain anything to other,writing diary
- **Negative Feelings**: feels like brain fog, I won't be able to think anything, picked up from CCL, was for a student. He thanked me for arranging to get the device so quickly, I didn't like his thank you. Because I did more than just arranging I picked it up from Agronomy, not only arranging. ?,I am really sensitive in getting recongnision of my work, at least verbally,I don't want anything in return (is it true?), I generally don't ask for help, but if I ask for it, I would like the people whom I helped before to help me with his full effort, the way I did.
- **Possible Reasons and Action Items**:I was exposed to cold, and then sudden temperature change inside the office, it caused the headache and it happened with me before. I need to be careful about it.,I need to have backup works that don't need to think, like fixing figures, making ppt, updating webpage, organizing files/folders, going through the notes I have taken earlier.

- **Physical and Mental Symptoms** : I have a report due today, last night I didn't feel restless. I used to feel so. I think the Buspirone is working to reduce my anxiety. But this morning, currently, I'm feeling spinning inside my head. I dressed up differently today : Jeans and Polo that I was not doing for months, I am feeling a bit uncomfortable, because the dresses are little loose.
- **Positive Feelings** :
I can think, I can write, I'm ok.
- **Negative Feelings** :
feeling uncomfortable with the dress, pain in the back of right knee.
- **Possible Reasons and Action Items**:
I think taking both lamictal (I'm phasing out of it slowly) and Buspirone might cause it, I'm not sure about it. Last night I ran and felt exhausted after that, that might cause it too.

### February 9, 2024

- **Positive Feelings** : i was not feeling restless like other times before any talk/writing 
- **Negative Feelings** : but trying to avoid it or didnt resist my temptation to do other stuff, for exsmple i got a all my physical therapist abiut an early appointment and told me if i can come in, i could say no and work on my proposal but i didnâ€™t, I convinced myself that physical therapy is important

- **Negative Feelings** : the headeach started after making buspirone and lipitor, no lamictal. Maybe i am having side effects of buspirone. I was not having this problem in the evening after taking buspirone.
